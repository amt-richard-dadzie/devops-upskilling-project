##  Labs Completed

### Lab 1.1: AWS CLI & Multi-Region Deployment 

- Multi-region S3 bucket deployment (us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1)
- Automated resource management with cleanup capabilities
- Shell scripting fundamentals and AWS CLI proficiency

### Lab 1.2: Well-Architected Framework Assessment 

- 3-tier web application architecture design
- Complete 6-pillar assessment (35+ improvements identified)
- Service quotas analysis and scalability planning
- Priority matrix with cost-benefit analysis

### Security Implementation 

- Automated security audit script
- IAM password policy implementation
- Security issue remediation documentation

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI v2 installed
- AWS credentials configured
- Git Bash or Linux/macOS terminal
- AWS account with appropriate permissions

### Lab 1.1: S3 Multi-Region Deployment

```bash
cd week1-aws-cli-deployment
chmod +x *.sh

# Deploy buckets across 3 regions
./deploy-s3-buckets.sh

# List all buckets with regions
./list-resources.sh

# Cleanup when done
./deploy-s3-buckets.sh --cleanup
```

### Lab 1.2: Architecture Assessment

### Security Audit & Fixes

```bash
cd shared-responsibility

# Run security audit
./security-audit.sh
```

##  Key Features

- Automated deployment across 3 AWS regions
- Timestamp-based unique naming
- Built-in cleanup and verification
- Handles region-specific configurations

### Architecture Assessment

- 3-tier web application design
- Complete Well-Architected Framework evaluation
- 35+ prioritized improvements identified
- Service quotas and scalability analysis
- Cost-benefit analysis with ROI calculations

### Security Implementation

- Automated security audit (11 checks)
- IAM password policy enforcement
- Compliance with PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2
- Security issue remediation guides

## ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights

### Shell Scripting

- VPC with public/private subnet segmentation

##  Results & Achievements

### Lab 1.1 Outcomes

-  Successfully deployed S3 buckets across 3 regions
-  Implemented automated cleanup with safety confirmations
-  Mastered AWS CLI regional configurations
-  Created reusable automation scripts

### Lab 1.2 Outcomes

-  Designed production-ready 3-tier architecture
-  Identified 35+ specific improvements across 6 pillars
-  Created priority matrix with cost-benefit analysis
-  Estimated 18% cost savings potential
-  Achieved compliance readiness (PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2)

### Security Implementation Outcomes

- Fixed critical IAM password policy issue
- Achieved compliance with security standards
- Created automated security audit process
- Documented remediation procedures

##  Common Issues & Solutions

### AWS CLI Issues

- **Permissions**: Ensure IAM user has required permissions
- **Credentials**: Verify AWS credentials are configured
- **Regions**: Check region availability and service quotas

### Script Execution

- **Permissions**: Run `chmod +x *.sh` to make scripts executable
- **Environment**: Use Git Bash on Windows or native terminal on Linux/macOS
- **Dependencies**: Ensure AWS CLI v2 is installed and configured

### Security Audit

- **IAM Permissions**: May need administrator access for some fixes
- **Policy Updates**: Some changes require account-level permissions
- **Verification**: Re-run audit after implementing fixes
